# Calorie-Tracker-Python
This was a final project for CS 521; Information Structures with Python. I developed a basic calorie tracker that stores foods that've been eaten for the day. These foods record calorie amount, protein, carbohydrate, and fat content. Also, this tracker calculates BMI and daily caloric intake for the day as well.
